# Long description
### What's the Problem?
COVID-19 and the associated restrictions imposed by governmental authorities have caught most industries and citizens off guard with little or no time to prepare. During the lockdown, online food and grocery deliveries have become one of the lifelines that people have come to depend on. This pandemic showed us how quickly consumer behavior changed and how quickly the restaurant industry had to adapt. From frontline workers needing to quickly grab a meal, to those of us that had to limit movement beyond our front yards, but still yearn for our favorite food, quick-service restaurants and employees are helping to feed and fuel us all through these unprecedented times. Even in the fifth phase of the nationwide lockdown, many still prefer ordering online and avoid stepping outside altogether as not everybody is used to cooking three meals a day while focusing on household chores and professional careers. As a result, food delivery aggregators are taking precautionary measures by following necessary guidelines like 'kitchen sanitization', 'contactless delivery', 'hand sanitization' and 'temperature check of riders', etc.
### How can technology help?
With COVID-19 transforming everything, we are all faced with significant new challenges—recognizing that consumer behavior can change in a moment, adapting to that shift, while protecting the vital employees who deliver a service that the overall economy relies on during a tough period. Our solution for the "new normalcy"—rely on innovative technology as the landscape shifts repeatedly so that consumers can order rapidly, everyone can stay safe, and the industry can remain prepared for what the future of the quick-service experience may look like.
### The idea
We're reimagining how customers navigate lines, with new and creative delivery options—reinventing the physical space to meet the needs of consumers that may want more touchless options and less face-to-face interactions. It is vital to provide a similar 'taste' experience as before while keeping in mind the guidelines to give the assurance of safety and hygiene across customers. Providing a platform with a service of monitoring food throughout the entire process starting from placing an order to food preparation and delivery, will enable consumers to be more trustworthy and relaxed while savoring their taste buds.

Creating an experience for users for ordering food in order to ensure all the necessary sanitation and hygiene requirements have been met with the ability for them to keep a track of the same. The project aims to help and accelerate the online food & beverage industry in the new normalcy by building a sense of trust and safety for the end users by publishing real time and detailed food preparation visual notifications and tracking.

# Long description
### What's the Problem?
COVID-19 and the associated restrictions imposed by governmental authorities have caught most industries and citizens off guard with little or no time to prepare. 
During the lockdown, online food and grocery deliveries have become one of the lifelines that people have come to depend on. 
This pandemic showed us how quickly consumer behaviour changed and how quickly the restaurant industry had to adapt. 
From frontline workers needing to quickly grab a meal, to those of us that had to limit movement beyond our front yards, but still yearn for our favourite food, quick-service restaurants and employees are helping to feed and fuel us all through these unprecedented times. 
Even in the fifth phase of the nationwide lockdown, many still wish to order online and avoid stepping outside altogether as not everybody is used to cooking three meals a day while focusing on household chores and professional careers. 
But due to the fear of getting affected with corona virus people are trying not to order online, with the recent data showing the no of orders of swiggy and zomato have reduced by 60%.
With this steep decline in the no of orders this industry is at a risk of getting vanished, how might we save an industry with some added layers of unbiased monitoring added which is a win win for both sides.
### How can technology help?
With COVID-19 transforming everything, we are all faced with significant new challenges—recognizing that consumer behavior can change in a moment, adapting to that shift, while protecting the vital employees who deliver a service that the overall economy relies on during a tough period. Our solution for the "new normalcy"—rely on innovative technology as the landscape shifts repeatedly so that consumers can order rapidly, everyone can stay safe, and the industry can remain prepared for what the future of the quick-service experience may look like.
### The idea

- Our solution Food Monitor is a 3rd party plugin idea that any food delivering service can use like swiggy & zomato. It's going to act in the same way as an antivirus works where be it any system the antivirus acts on top of it.
- While ordering the user can clearly see the restaurants/dishes on which food monitor tracking is available. Once user selects that dish and makes the payment a food monitor will be assigned to the order by our service who is going to be an unbiased invigilator of the order right from the start till the end. 
- Food monitor will be continuously tracking the chef, food preparation, delivery guy and delivery route, making sure the route followed is through green zones and will constantly be uploading the images of the steps along with the checklist related to that step, the step is a pass from food monitor if and only if all the checkpoints are a pass.
- In case there is a breach of hygiene security at any point the food monitor cancels the order and user receives a notification showing a failed stamp on the order.
However in case all steps are a pass then the food monitor shares the Approved tracking report with a pass stamp and the user is relieved that his order is successful and hygienic.
